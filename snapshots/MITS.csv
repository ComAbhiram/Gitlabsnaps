Header → Navigation / Mega Menu : Mega menu overlaps header menu items on smaller screen sizes," When the screen size is reduced (responsive view), the mega menu opens and overlaps the main header menu items, causing display issues and potentially affecting navigation usability.
Steps to Reproduce:

Open the website on a desktop.

Reduce the screen width gradually (or use mobile responsive view in dev tools).

Hover or click on a header menu item that opens a mega menu (e.g., “Students”).

Observe how the mega menu overlaps existing header elements.
Expected Result: The mega menu should open cleanly without overlapping the main header elements.
Actual Result: Mega menu content overlaps the header items and affects layout clarity.

Multiple Console Errors and Warnings Impacting Functionality and Performance,"The application is experiencing the following critical console errors and warnings:
[text](https://www.mits.dev6.intersmarthosting.in/)
Back/Forward Cache Issue

Error: Unchecked runtime.lastError: The page keeping the extension port is moved into back/forward cache, so the message channel is closed.
Impact: Extension communication may break when navigating browser history.
WebSocket Connection Failure

Error: WebSocket connection to 'wss://ws.jam.dev/graphql' failed: Establishing a tunnel via proxy server failed.
Impact: Real-time data fetch via WebSocket is not functioning.
Failed Fetch Requests

Error: Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to fetch at sw.js:2279.
Impact: Resources fail to load, leading to broken functionality.
MobX-State-Tree Errors

Error: [mobx-state-tree] You are trying to read or write to an object that is no longer part of a state tree.
Impact: Data binding and state management issues causing potential crashes or unexpected behavior.
Blocked Resources

Error: Denying load of chrome-extension://pbcpfbcibpcbfbmddogfhcijfpboeaaf/inject.js. Resources must be listed in the web_accessible_resources manifest key in order to be loaded by pages outside the extension.
Impact: Chrome extension is unable to inject scripts, leading to missing functionality.
404 Resource Not Found

Error: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found).
Impact: Missing resources cause UI elements or scripts to malfunction.
Google Analytics Blocked

Error: Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT at www.google-analytics.com.
Impact: Analytics tracking is blocked, affecting data collection.
Swiper Loop Mode Issue

Warning: Swiper Loop Warning: The number of slides is not enough for loop mode, it will be disabled or not function properly.
Impact: Carousel or slider functionality is broken or degraded.
Asynchronous Response Error

Error: Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received.
Impact: Unresponsive listeners lead to incomplete or failed asynchronous operations.
General Resource Loading Failures

Errors: Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FAILED and similar issues.
Impact: Various resources (images, scripts, etc.) fail to load, affecting user experience.
Suggested Fixes:
Address state-tree detachment issues in MobX by detaching nodes before removal or avoiding usage post-removal.
Debug WebSocket proxy configuration to ensure proper tunneling.
Ensure all required resources are accessible and listed in the appropriate manifest (e.g., web_accessible_resources).
Resolve missing or broken fetch requests by verifying endpoints and resource availability.
Add sufficient slides or adjust slidesPerView and slidesPerGroup in Swiper configurations.
Investigate and fix back/forward cache issues to maintain extension port stability across navigation.
Whitelist analytics scripts if needed for better tracking.
Conduct testing to ensure no asynchronous operations leave unresponsive listeners.![Screenshot_2025-04-25_at_2.11.26_PM](/uploads/5b9a4de34f0cfcaac125ec7174bc7077/Screenshot_2025-04-25_at_2.11.26_PM.png)",172,https://gitlab.com/ManualProjects/php/cmsphpcust25/mits/-/issues/172,Open,BugSlayer,abhiram9,"","",No,No,,2025-04-25 08:41:22,2025-05-06 06:21:52,,,,"Dev Test Phase 2,HTML,Not Fixed,P0,Status : New,Type : Bug",0,0
Unable to Create Admin User – Password Field Format Error,"Environment:

URL: https://www.mits.dev6.intersmarthosting.in/admin-portal/users/create
Browser: Safari
Device: MacBook
Date: 28 April 2025
Description:
When trying to create a new admin user in the ""Admin Control Panel → Users → Create Admin"" section, the form submission fails with an error message: ""Something went wrong"".
Additionally, the password field shows ""The password field format is invalid"", even though the password meets common requirements.

Steps to Reproduce:

Navigate to the Admin Control Panel → Users → Create Admin.
Fill in the Name, Email, and Password fields, and confirm the password.
Select a Role.
Click the Create button.
Expected Result:
The new admin user should be created successfully.

Actual Result:
An error banner (""Something went wrong"") appears, and the password field shows an invalid format error.![Screenshot_2025-04-28_at_11.25.25_AM](/uploads/faa65c394790bc636734d540557fbb92/Screenshot_2025-04-28_at_11.25.25_AM.png)",195,https://gitlab.com/ManualProjects/php/cmsphpcust25/mits/-/issues/195,Open,BugSlayer,abhiram9,"","",No,No,,2025-04-28 05:58:40,2025-05-06 16:43:54,,,,"Dev Test Phase 2,Functional,P0,Status : Reopened,Type : Bug",0,0
Contact Form – Error Messages Are Not Clearly Visible,"Environment:

URL: https://www.mits.dev6.intersmarthosting.in/contact
Browser: Safari
Device: MacBook
Date: 28 April 2025
Description:
On the Contact page, when users enter invalid information into the form fields (like email and phone number), error messages are displayed but are not clearly visible. The text blends into the background or is too subtle to catch the user's attention easily.

Steps to Reproduce:

Navigate to the Contact page.
Enter invalid email and phone number values.
Try to submit the form.
Observe the error messages under the input fields.
Expected Result:
Error messages should be clearly visible — using a contrasting color (e.g., red text on a white/light background) and appropriate font size to alert users immediately.

Actual Result:
Error messages appear but are difficult to notice because they are either too faint, too small, or blend into the background color.

Impact:
Users may miss the error messages and fail to correct their entries, leading to failed form submissions and poor user experience.

Additional Notes:

Suggest increasing the font size, changing the error text color (e.g., red or dark bold color), and possibly adding an error icon next to the message.
Good accessibility practices (like WCAG compliance) recommend a color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for text.",198,https://gitlab.com/ManualProjects/php/cmsphpcust25/mits/-/issues/198,Open,BugSlayer,abhiram9,"","",No,No,,2025-04-28 07:47:17,2025-05-06 08:42:21,,,,"Dev Test Phase 2,HTML,Not Fixed,P1,Type : Bug",0,0

t is possible to create a submenu for an already deactivated main menu,"When creating a menu, it is possible to create a submenu under a main menu that has already been deactivated. This should not be allowed, as deactivated main menus should not support the creation of submenus.

Steps to Reproduce:

Go to the Menu Management page.
Deactivate a main menu (mark it as deactivated).
Try to create a submenu under the deactivated main menu.
Submit the submenu creation.
Expected Result:
The system should prevent the creation of a submenu under a deactivated main menu. An error or validation message should inform the user that submenus cannot be created for deactivated menus.

Actual Result:
It is possible to create a submenu for a deactivated main menu without any error or validation message.![Screenshot_2025-04-28_at_3.15.09_PM](/uploads/9d0fc3a4288fe8127e6c60356763a869/Screenshot_2025-04-28_at_3.15.09_PM.png)

In the Research > Notifications section, the Title field shows a limit of 200 characters, but when submitting, it throws an error saying:

""The title field must not be greater than 191 characters.""

This inconsistency misleads users and results in submission errors.

🧪 Steps to Reproduce:
Go to Research > Notifications in the dashboard.

Enter a title with around 195-200 characters.

Submit the form.

Receive error: “Title must not be greater than 191 characters.”

🚫 Actual Behavior:
UI allows up to 200 characters.
